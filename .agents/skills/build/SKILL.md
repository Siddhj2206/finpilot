# Build

## The Containerfile

It is the source of truth for image assembly, and it is written to be read. Its
structure, in order:

1. **Identity** — `ARG IMAGE_NAME`, `IMAGE_VENDOR`, `UBLUE_IMAGE_TAG`, and the
   `# Name:` comment. The name actually published is the repository name; these
   are the local fallback and the image metadata.
2. **Context stage** — `COPY build /build`, `COPY custom /custom`, then the two
   OCI images into `/oci/common` and `/oci/brew`.
3. **Base** — the `FROM` line. The single source for the Fedora major, the base
   image name, and the digest.
4. **Phases** — one `RUN` block per script, in the order they are named.
   [build/README.md](../../../build/README.md) lists them.
5. **Metadata** — the `LABEL` block, fed by ARGs declared late so a new version
   or commit only invalidates the label layer.

Order matters for cache: volatile values go after the expensive layers.

## The Justfile

```bash
just build            # build the image
just build-qcow2      # build a QCOW2 disk image
just build-iso        # build an installer ISO
just run-vm-qcow2     # boot the image in a VM
just test-unit        # run the suite
just lint             # shellcheck every tracked script
just check            # verify Justfile syntax
```

`just --list` has the rest. `IMAGE_NAME` defaults to the value in the Justfile
and is overridable by the `IMAGE_NAME` environment variable; CI sets that from
the repository name.

## Pinning

Every OCI reference is pinned by digest and updated by Renovate: the base image,
`projectbluefin/common`, `ublue-os/brew`, `bootc-image-builder`, and the GitHub
Actions. Do not hand-edit a digest; let Renovate propose it.

The base image's `FROM` line is the only place the Fedora major is written. It
is read at build time from the base's `os-release`, so it cannot desync from the
tag the way a hand-maintained ARG could.

## Examples

`build/*.sh.example` are inactive until you activate them: rename the file off
`.example` and add a `RUN` block after the package phase.
[build/README.md](../../../build/README.md) has the block to copy.
